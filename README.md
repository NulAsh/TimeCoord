# TimeCoord
Swap one of space coordinates with time

To run this, you need ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe available in the PATH

You can get ffmpeg builds for windows from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows

If you run TimeCoord without parameters, it will tell you how to use it:

```
Command syntax:
TimeCoord invideo outvideo [-p params]
where:
  invideo  - filename of input video
  outvideo - filename of output video
  params   - optional parameters to give to ffmpeg for encoding output video
```
